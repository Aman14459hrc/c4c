                <h2>Automated Waste Sorting: Towards a Greener Future</h2>
                <p>
                In a world grappling with increasing waste generation, efficient waste sorting has become more crucial than ever. Our project aims to revolutionize waste management by automating the sorting process, making it smarter, faster, and more accurate
                </p>
                <h2>Work </h2>
                <p>Our primary goal is to sort at least three different types of waste: plastic, metal, and glass. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, weâ€™re creating an intelligent waste sorting system that directs each type of waste into its respective bin. Imagine a future where waste bins know exactly what to collect, reducing contamination and promoting recycling.</p>
           <h2>Future prospectus</h2>
           <p>While our current prototype is just the beginning, we envision widespread adoption of similar waste sorting systems. Imagine smart bins in households, offices, and industrial settings, all contributing to a cleaner environment.</p>
